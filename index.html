    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>This project aims to design, configure, and demonstrate a distributed computing cluster built from six physical servers. By combining their processing power through OpenMPI, the system will run parallel workloads and provide a practical demonstration of distributed computing concepts, which will be benchmarked with the use of the “Jack the Ripper” password cracking service, and compared to a non-clustered gpu. After the comparisons are made, a research paper and github site will be written and set up respectively. Additionally, a secure, web-based dashboard will be developed to monitor server status and task progress, accessible via Google OAuth authentication.</p>
